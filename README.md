## SIMPLE NET LIB

Simple Net Lib [SNL] is an abstract network communication.

This project contains the abstract communication layer and no implementations at all.
Therefore this project is more of the template to implement the protocol.

# WHAT IT DOES THEN?

This is the template guideline for implementing SNL protocol, it contains all the base classes and network abstractions needed for making a implementation.
